Weather Extractor
=================

This sample extractor queries the publicly available Frost API from The
Norwegian Meteorological Institute for observational data on e.g. temperature,
air pressure or wind speed on a configured set of observational stations.

To use the Frost API, you need to get credentials for it. It a very straight
foreward processs, follow the instructions
[here](https://frost.met.no/auth/requestCredentials.html). You will only need
the client ID for this extractor.

The data from the Frost APIs comes from **The Norwegian Meteorological
Institute**, and is licensed under Norwegian license for public data (NLOD) and
